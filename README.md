# React Native Timeline App

This is a React Native application that displays a timeline of posts from an API. Users can view posts, like/unlike them, and scroll through an infinite list of posts.

## Key Features

- Fetches and displays posts from an API
- Implements infinite scrolling for loading more posts
- Allows users to like and unlike posts
- Clean and modular code structure

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── PostItem.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── usePosts.ts
├── services/
│   └── api.ts
├── types/
│   └── index.ts
└── App.tsx
```

- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects
- `services/`: API service functions
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `App.tsx`: Main application component

## Clean Implementation and Structure

1. **Modular Components**: The `PostItem` component is responsible for rendering individual posts, promoting reusability and maintainability.

2. **Custom Hooks**: The `usePosts` hook encapsulates the logic for fetching posts, managing likes, and handling pagination, separating concerns from the UI components.

3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.

4. **API Service**: The `api.ts` file centralizes all API calls, making it easier to manage and update API endpoints.

## Scalability

1. **Pagination**: The app implements infinite scrolling, allowing it to handle large amounts of data efficiently.

2. **State Management**: For larger applications, consider implementing a state management solution like Redux or MobX for more complex state interactions.

3. **Code Splitting**: As the app grows, consider implementing code splitting and lazy loading for better performance.

## Deployment

To deploy this React Native application:

1. **iOS**:
   - Set up an Apple Developer account
   - Configure your app in Xcode
   - Archive and upload your app to the App Store

2. **Android**:
   - Set up a Google Play Developer account
   - Generate a signed APK or Android App Bundle
   - Upload your app to the Google Play Console

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Fastlane, Bitrise, or GitHub Actions for automated building and deployment.

4. **OTA Updates**:
   - Consider implementing over-the-air (OTA) updates using a service like CodePush to push quick updates without going through the app store review process.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. For iOS development:
   - Navigate to the iOS folder: `cd ios`
   - Install CocoaPods dependencies: `pod install`
   - Return to the project root: `cd ..`
4. Run the Metro bundler: `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Run on iOS: `npm run ios` or `yarn ios`
6. Run on Android: `npm run android` or `yarn android`
